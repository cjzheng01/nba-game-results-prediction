    "# Summary\n",
    "We used some statistics from basketball-reference.com to calculate the Elo score of each NBA team and used these basic statistics to evaluate the past games of each team, and compared the teams according to the rating method \"Elo Score\". The current team's performance and the characteristics of these different teams are finally used to determine which team can have the advantage in a game.  Unlike some other predictions, in our prediction results, we did not determine the results of each game by only saying the winner. Instead, we calculated the probability of our results. One improvement for this project would be the amount of data we use to evaluate the performance of the team is too small (only the 2018-2019 season's data). If you want a more accurate and systematic judgment, you should get more statistics of each NBA team from previous years for prediction. "
